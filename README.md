# Chrome Workspace

Its like setting up your startpage(s) in Chrome, but better.

## Features

- Save the positions and states of your currently opened Chrome windows and tabs.
- Load your configuration, and load them again, and again, and again...
- Load your configuration in a clean state, meaning all open Chrome tabs will be closed beforehand.

> Works with multiple screens
